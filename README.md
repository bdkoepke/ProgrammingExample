Simple programming example that introduces interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, dependency injection, recursion, function objects, implementation hiding, and general code reuse. Also (unfortunately) has a singleton in the debug class. This is really the only place that this should ever be used. If you have a dependency injection framework then please inject the logger.
